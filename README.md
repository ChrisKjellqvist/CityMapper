# CityMapper
Uses the Google Geocoding API to collect data regarding addresses over different cities and stores them in a format suitable for my other project, DataDrawer, to draw over a map. Some complete examples of Houston.

I would have made it so that the requests were 1:1 for the pixels on the image, but I did this with the free API code and that would have taken almost two years so I chose to opt with this lower resolution version and collected the data over 3 weeks. To add, in the latest version, there is a legend for the gradient on the bottom left but the first picture in the example album does not. All of the rest do, though.
