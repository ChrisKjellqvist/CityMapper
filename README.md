# CityMapper
Uses the Google Geocoding API to collect data regarding addresses over different cities and stores them in a format suitable for my other project, DataDrawer, to draw over a map. Some complete examples of Houston.

For these pictures, I made 62500 requests to google and plotted those over a 1280x1280 image, taken from the Google Maps Static Map API. I would have made it so that the requests were 1:1 for the pixels on the image, but I did this with the free API code and that would have taken almost two years so I chose to opt with this lower resolution version and collected the data over 3 weeks.
