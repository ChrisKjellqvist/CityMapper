# CityMapper
This project started with the question: Why is my address what it is? What patterns apply to city addresses in different cities? Are they all the same or do they all follow different patterns? 
Using the Google Geocoding API, I sampled address data from a square over the cities Houston and Boston. This can be done to any city but it currently has to be hardcoded. It assembles this data into a format readable by the DataDrawer project.

Some examples of the finished project:
